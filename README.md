# **Project 4 - Data-Driven Customer Segmentation: RFM Model for SuperStore**

**Context:**

SuperStore is a global retail company with a large number of customers. On the occasion of Christmas and New Year, the Marketing department wants to run marketing campaigns to show appreciation to the customers who have supported the company throughout the year, as well as to target potential customers who could become loyal customers.

However, the Marketing department has not yet been able to segment each customer group for this year because the dataset is too large to process manually as in previous years. Therefore, they are seeking assistance from the Data Analysis department to implement a segmentation classification task for each customer to deploy appropriate marketing programs for each customer group.

The Marketing Director has also proposed using the RFM model; however, in the past, when the company's scale was smaller, the team could calculate and classify using Excel. Currently, due to the large amount of data, they hope the Data department can develop a flow to evaluate segmentation through Python programming.
